# Yuckdonaldâ€™s is considering opening a series of restaurants along Quaint Valley Highway (QVH).
# The n possible locations are along a straight line, and the distances of these locations from the start of QVH are,
# in miles and in increasing order, m1, m2, . . . , mn. The constraints are as follows:
# r At each location, Yuckdonaldâ€™s may open at most one restaurant.
#   The expected profit from opening a restaurant at location i is pi , where pi > 0 and i = 1,2,...,n.
# r Any two restaurants should be at least k miles apart, where k is a positive integer.
# Give an efficient algorithm to compute the maximum expected total profit subject to the given constraints.
